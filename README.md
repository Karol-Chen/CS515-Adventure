## Time Spent on the Project
- Estimated hours spent: 13 hours

## Code Testing
- Automated Unit Testing: utilized Python's unittest framework for developing automated tests.
- Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions: configured GitHub Actions to automatically run our test suite on every commit.
- Manual Testing: regular sessions of playing the game were conducted to understand the player's perspective better.

## Known Bugs or Issues
No

## Resolved Challenges
- Challenge: Initially, I used a large number of if statements to try to handle various scenarios, but this led to a lot of duplicated code, logical errors, and a more complicated code structure.
- Solution: I adopted Python's construct machine to refactor the code, which not only effectively streamlined the code but also reduced the occurrence of errors and made debugging less challenging.

## Implemented Extensions
List and describe the extensions or new features you've added. Be specific on how they can be exercised and where they are located in the map. For example:
- New Verb `help`: tell players what the valid verbs are.
- New Verb `drop`: take something from your inventory and put it down in the room.
- winning condition: There is a room named "Boss Room". When the players enter the room, if they carry "magic wand" and "sword" in the inventory, they win. Otherwise, they lose.
